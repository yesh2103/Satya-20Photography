# Admin Email Confirmation Fix

## Issue
The admin user `rajkarthikeya10@gmail.com` is getting an "Email not confirmed" error when trying to login.

## Solutions

### Option 1: Confirm Email in Supabase Dashboard (Recommended)
1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to **Authentication** → **Users**
3. Find the user with email: `rajkarthikeya10@gmail.com`
4. If the user doesn't exist:
   - Click "Add User"
   - Email: `rajkarthikeya10@gmail.com`
   - Password: `SatyaANil@0804`
   - Check "Auto Confirm User" checkbox
   - Click "Create User"
5. If the user exists but email is not confirmed:
   - Click the three dots (...) next to the user
   - Select "Confirm User"

### Option 2: Disable Email Confirmation Globally
1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to **Authentication** → **Settings**
3. Scroll down to "Email Auth" section
4. **Uncheck** "Enable email confirmations"
5. Save the settings

### Option 3: Update User via SQL (Advanced)
If you have access to the SQL editor in Supabase:

```sql
-- Find the user in auth.users table
SELECT id, email, email_confirmed_at FROM auth.users WHERE email = 'rajkarthikeya10@gmail.com';

-- Confirm the email (replace USER_ID with actual user ID)
UPDATE auth.users 
SET email_confirmed_at = NOW() 
WHERE email = 'rajkarthikeya10@gmail.com';
```

## Admin Credentials

## After Fixing Email Confirmation
Once the email is confirmed, the admin will be able to:
- Login to the admin dashboard
- Manage media uploads
- View contact form submissions
- Manage packages
- Access all admin-only features

## Verification
After applying the fix:
1. Try logging in with the admin credentials
2. Should redirect to `/admin` dashboard
