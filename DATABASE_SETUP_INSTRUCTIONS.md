# Database Setup Instructions

## Current Status
Your Satya Photography website is now functional, but you need to set up the database in Supabase to enable full functionality.

## Issues Fixed
✅ **About Page**: Updated with better content, added your founder image, removed "Award Winning" badge, and streamlined the team section
✅ **Authentication Error**: Fixed user profile creation error with better error handling and database policies
✅ **Protected Routes**: Packages and Contact pages are working correctly - they require login (this is by design)

## Next Steps Required

### 1. Set Up Database in Supabase
You need to run the SQL schema in your Supabase dashboard:

1. Go to your Supabase dashboard: https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Select your project: `qvltkifxjmxbqdzcapvl`
3. Go to **SQL Editor** in the left sidebar
4. Copy and paste the entire content from `database/schema.sql`
5. Click **Run** to execute the SQL

### 2. Test the Application
After running the database schema:

1. **Try to create an account** - Go to `/login` and sign up with a new account
2. **Test Google Sign-in** - Click "Continue with Google" 
3. **Access protected pages** - Once logged in, you can access:
   - `/packages` - View photography packages
   - `/contact` - Submit contact forms
   - `/admin` - Admin dashboard (for owner accounts only)

### 3. Create Owner Account
After setting up the database, you can upgrade your account to owner:

1. Sign up normally first
2. In Supabase, go to **Table Editor** > **users** table
3. Find your user record and change the `role` from `'user'` to `'owner'`
4. This will give you access to the admin dashboard
